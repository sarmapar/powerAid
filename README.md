To run the app, run the line

`runGitHub('poweraid', 'sarmapar', subdir = "poweraid_app")`

For this to work, make sure the package shiny is installed and loaded. All other packages will install and load on their own. It may take a moment the first time you run it, then it should be quick the subsequent times you launch it.
